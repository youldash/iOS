## Outline

Over the course of this workshop, we have shown you how to accomplish:

* Exercise [1](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%201#exercise-1-photography-10) → Build smaller (atomic) components using Xcode's Command Line Utility for testing them out separately before adding them into the bigger picture.
* Exercise [2](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%201#exercise-2-photography-20) → Build your very first iOS app that tested your previous atomic components through simple UI. In this exercise, we have also shown you how the MVC (Model View Controller) design paradigm was put into action (by separating your logic  code from both UI and controller classes).
* Exercises [3](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%202#exercise-3-arrays) through [5](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%202#exercise-5-multidimensional-arrays) → Construct custom Collection classes (i.e. both Unidimensional and Multidimensional Array facades) as atomic components for later use in proceeding tasks.
* Exercise [6](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%203#exercise-6-enumerators-and-enumerables) → Establish the foundations of your final iOS app (and modifying it to suite our needs). In addition to adding a few extra enumerable/iterative components (including their enumerators).
* Exercise [7](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%203#exercise-7-containers) → Build the skeleton code (using the Container class) for building Scene Graphs.
* Exercise [8 (Part I)](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%203#exercise-8-scene-graph-nodes-and-edges) → Construct the Nodes of your Scene Graphs.
* Exercise [8 (Part II) ](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%204#exercise-8-scene-graph-nodes-and-edges-continueds) → Construct the Edges and actual Graph facades of your Scene Graph app. The exercise also included a few tasks for constructing both Node and Edge enumerator and enumerable utility classes.
* Exercise [9](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Day%204#exercise-9-enumerating-scene-graph-objects) → Build the skeleton code (using the Container class) for building Scene Graphs.

In this final part, we will take you through the necessary steps for putting everything you've built together, along with a number of important steps for making your final product more appealing, and user responsive.

## Exercise 10: Scene Graph Nodes and Edges (Continued)



> **Note:** Xcode project files for this exercise will be pushed to this repo, later.

## Wrap-up

**Congratulations!** You have made it through our intensive training course :)

Though... I have a confession to make! This is an enormous amount of information and should probably be a very lengthy handout. Nevertheless, I hope that you've enjoyed what was covered so far, and at least you've got a better understanding in making your ideas a living reality.

Thank you for sharing your interests!
Your feedback would definitely count towards making such workshops a success!

For any training requests (and if you have any specific topic you would like me to explain), please [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/youldash) and I will (definitely) get back to as soon as I can!

Best wishes,
