## About

You have made it to the iOS developer essentials workshop repo! Congratulations :)

> ***Update:*** This repo is under construction at the moment. For more updates please follow [@UQU_CS](https://twitter.com/UQU_CS) on Twitter.

This workshop (or course if you will) is an intensive 5-day event, which is designed for UQU college students whom are proficient with any modern, Object-Oriented language like Java and C++. **Attendees must have a solid (sound) understanding of Object-Oriented principles prior entry into the course.**

Attendees will receive 5-full days of training on campus (with sessions varying from 3- to 4-hours depending on the allocated schedule, which will be allocated by the Department).

Attendees are **highly recommended** to bring their own Apple laptops, running the [latest public release of the Xcode development software](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). As this course is specifically designed to cover many topics in a (rather) short period, we recommended that every participant should gain access to (at least) a private Mac computer at their own pace, and gain practical expertise by learning additional topics not covered during the course.

Over the course of training, participants will be asked to signup (using this site) and create new (free) accounts that could be used for collaboration, and mainly, for submitting assignment work to the instructor (for further assessment). This process is the only accepted method for completing each announced task/assignment.

> **Important:** **Certificates of Completion** will be granted to attendees, upon the successful completion of tasks that will be announced during the event. **Certificates for Attendance** on the other hand, will not be issued, to guarantee the full benefit of training, participation, and collaboration during the course of the workshop.

## Preface

The app-making process for iOS devices (iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad) relies on a special, yet easy to learn paradigm for creating mobile apps. Developers are challenged to provide their users with fun, joyful, and memorable experiences.

In this workshop, we present Apple's approach to building a [Scene Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph) iOS app. A **Scene Graph** is a general [Data Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) that is commonly used by vector-based graphics editing apps like [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) and  [AutoCAD](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview), and modern computer games. These apps often arrange both logical and spatial representations of a graphical scene using specific **Graph** structure elements: **Nodes** and **Edges**.

At the end of the course, you will be able to develop a fully-fledged Scene Graph iOS app that is capable of establishing two-dimensional Scene Graph instances in a dynamic fashion. In other words, you will be able to dynamically construct the Nodes and Edges of a typical Scene Graph, while arranging their spacial positions using "touch" as the primary method of input.

The final product should look similarly to the following iPad mockup (or screenshot):
