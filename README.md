## About

You have made it to the iOS developer essentials workshop repo! Congratulations :)

## Preface

The app-making process for iOS devices (iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad) relies on a special, yet easy to learn paradigm for creating mobile apps. Developers are challenged to provide their users with fun, joyful, and memorable experiences.

In this workshop, we present Apple's approach to building a [Scene Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph) iOS app. A **Scene Graph** is a general [Data Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) that is commonly used by vector-based graphics editing apps like [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) and  [AutoCAD](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview), and modern computer games. These apps often arrange both logical and spatial representations of a graphical scene using specific **Graph** structure elements: **Nodes** and **Edges**.

At the end of the course, you will be able to develop a fully-fledged Scene Graph iOS app that is capable of establishing two-dimensional Scene Graph instances in a dynamic fashion. In other words, you will be able to dynamically construct the Nodes and Edges of a typical Scene Graph, while arranging their spacial positions using "touch" as the primary method of input.

The final product should look similarly to the following iPad mockup (or screenshot):
