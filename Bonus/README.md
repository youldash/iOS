## Outline

In this part of the training course, we will introduce you to a few extra projects that will facilitate the idea of making both **class** and **instance** methods...

> **See:** The accompanying ["Graphs" Xcode Command Line Tool](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Bonus/Graphs) for a complete example ([download the Zip archive](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Bonus/Graphs.zip)).

> **See:** The accompanying ["App" Xcode iOS project](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Bonus/App) for a simple example on alert views ([download the Zip archive](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Bonus/App.zip)).

> **See:** The accompanying ["Rectangle" Xcode Command Line Tool](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Bonus/App) for a simple refresher example on coding basics (as requested by students) ([download the Zip archive](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Bonus/Rectangle.zip)).

> **See:** The accompanying ["AlbumApp" iOS TableView project](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Bonus/App) for an iOS TableView example ([download the Zip archive](https://github.com/youldash/iOS/tree/master/Bonus/AlbumApp.zip)).

## Compiling the "Graphs" Project

* Compile and run the program by clicking on the Run button (located on the top-left corner of Xcode), or by pressing (âŒ˜ + R). You should see an outcome similar to the following Debugger output:
